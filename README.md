# Traffic Data Analysis
In this repository, I analyzed trends and factors relating to fuel consumption based on traffic data in five fictional cities to extract insights for a fuel company. The analysis was visualized on a dashboard published on Tableau.

## Background
I am a data analyst at a fuel company in a futuristic urban setting where fuel is used to provide energy for transportation needs. As a data analyst at a fuel company, it is crucial to understand the market and gain insights from it to build strategies for the company. The data used is traffic data set in six diverse cities gained from the Department of Transportation's public data and is saved in a csv file format.

## Problem Statement
As a data analyst at a fuel company, skills of understanding the market and extracting business insights from data are needed. By examining traffic data, it is possible to do that. Data analysts have to get to know about the correlation between variables in analyzed data, and use data to find out about consumer behavior can then be analyzed. By gaining information from data, it is targeted for the company to increase energy consumption, and therefore, fuel consumption. The insights are aimed to be displayed in the form of an interactive dashboard after 5 working days.
